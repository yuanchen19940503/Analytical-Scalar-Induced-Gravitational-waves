Our method, presented in arXiv:2407.12914, is applicable not only for calculating the scalar-induced gravitational wave spectrum generated by a broken power-law power spectrum but also for any arbitrary power spectrum.

Here, we use the broken power-law power spectrum as an example to demonstrate how to perform an analytical approximation of the scalar-induced gravitational wave spectrum. Additionally, our code includes a comparison between our analytical results and numerical results.
